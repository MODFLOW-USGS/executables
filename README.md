# MODFLOW EXECUTABLES

The purpose of this repository is to distribute binaries for MODFLOW and related programs. Distributions are provided for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. Programs are compiled using [pymake](https://github.com/modflowpy/pymake) and Intel OneAPI compilers. The release also includes a json file [`code.json`](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/executables/releases/latest/download/code.json) that includes, for each program, the current version number, the URL that can be used to download the source files, and the date sources were last updated. A markdown version of this file, `code.md` is also included in the distribution.

Executables for these different operating systems can be found under the [release](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/executables/releases) tab above and are named:

* [win64.zip](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/executables/releases/latest/download/win64.zip)
* [mac.zip](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/executables/releases/latest/download/mac.zip)
* [linux.zip](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/executables/releases/latest/download/linux.zip)
